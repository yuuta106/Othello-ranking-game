    <h1>About This Game</h1>

    <p>
    This website provides a browser-based Othello (Reversi) game where players can compete against a CPU opponent.
    Othello is a classic strategy board game played on an 8×8 board. Players take turns placing black and white stones.
    When a player traps the opponent’s stones between their own, those stones are flipped.
    The player with the most stones at the end of the game wins.
    </p>

    <p>
    Your final score equals the number of stones you control at the end of the match.
    High scores are recorded in the ranking system, allowing players to compete for top positions.
